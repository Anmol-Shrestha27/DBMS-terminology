    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
        A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, and
        delete data in the database. DBMS manage the data, the database engine, and the database schema, allowing for
        data to be manipulated or extracted by users and other programs.
    </p>
    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p>
        Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data. A DBMS
        serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete
        data in the database.
    </p>
    <h2>Meta-data</h2>
    <p>
        Metadata can be a directory in the database that allows users to easily sort and filter data by type and
        establish relationships between different data sets. A DBMS catalog is associated with data collection and
        contains information that defines database articles.
    </p>
    <h2>Data-Dictionary</h2>
    <p>A data dictionary in Database Management System (DBMS) can be defined as a component that stores the
        collection of names, definitions, and attributes for data elements that are being used in a database. The
        Data Dictionary stores metadata, i.e., data about the database.</p>

    <h2>Data-base</h2>
    <p>
        What is DBMS? Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries
        on data. A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read,
        update, and delete data in the database.
    </p>
    <h2>Table</h2>
    <p>
        Tables are database objects that contain all the data in a database. In tables, data is logically organized in a
        row-and-column format similar to a spreadsheet. Each row represents a unique record, and each column represents
        a field in the record.
    </p>
    <h2>Tuple(s)</h2>
    <p>In the context of DBMS, a tuple refers to a single row or record in a database table. It is an ordered set of
        values representing a specific entity or object. Each attribute or column in a table corresponds to a value in
        the tuple.</p>
    <h2>Field(s)</h2>
    <p>
        A database field refers to a set of values arranged in a table and has the same data type. A field is also known
        as a column or attribute. It is not necessary for the values included in a field to be in the form of text
        alone, as this is not a requirement.
    </p>
    <h2>Domain(s)</h2>
    <p>In database management, a domain is a set of values that can be stored in a column of a database table. A domain
        is usually defined by a column's data type, which determines the kind of values that can be stored in the
        column. For example, a column with a data type of INTEGER can only store numeric values.</p>
    <h2>Contraint(s)</h2>
    <p>Constraints in DBMS (Database Management Systems) are rules or conditions that are applied to the data within a
        database to ensure data integrity, consistency, and adherence to business rules. They define limitations and
        requirements that the data must meet, thereby preventing the entry of invalid or inconsistent data.</p>
    <h2>Keys(s)</h2>
    <p>A key refers to an attribute/a set of attributes that help us identify a row (or tuple) uniquely in a table (or
        relation). A key is also used when we want to establish relationships between the different columns and tables
        of a relational database.
        Keys are of seven broad types in DBMS:
        <ol>
       <li> Candidate Key.</li>
       <li> Primary Key.</li>
       <li> Foreign Key.</li>
       <li> Super Key.</li>
       <li> Alternate Key.</li>
       <li> Composite Key.</li>
       <li> Unique Key.</li></ol></p>
